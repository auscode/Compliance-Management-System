/*
This function adds a compliance incident to a compliance management system. 
It checks if the system is not already full, if the incident type is valid, 
if the incident description is valid, and if the incident severity is valid. 
If all checks pass, the function adds the incident to the system and increments 
the number of incidents in the system. If any of the checks fail, the function 
returns without adding the incident to the system.

The function takes as input a ComplianceManagementSystem object and calculates the 
average severity of all incidents in the system. It first checks if there are any 
incidents in the system and returns 0 if there are none. Then, it loops through 
all incidents in the system and adds up the severity of each one based on its type. 
Finally, it calculates the average severity and returns it as a float value.

This function removes all incidents of a given type from a Compliance Management System. 
It loops through all incidents in the system, checks if the incident matches the type to be removed, 
shifts all incidents after this one back by one position, decrements the number of incidents in the system, 
and increments the number of removed incidents. Finally, it zeros out the remaining incidents that were 
shifted back and returns the number of incidents that were removed.

This function takes a ComplianceManagementSystem object as input, which contains a list of incidents, 
and returns the incident with the highest severity. If there are no incidents, the function returns a 
default empty incident with a data privacy type and a message stating "No incidents in the system." 
The function loops through all incidents in the system and compares their severity with the current highest severity incident, 
updating it if a higher severity incident is found. The function returns the highest severity incident found.

This function updates the severity of a compliance incident in a management system. 
It takes three parameters: a pointer to the compliance management system, the compliance incident to be updated, 
and the new severity value. The function searches for the incident in the system, and if found, checks if the 
new severity value is within the allowed range of 1-10. If the new severity is within the range, it updates 
the incident's severity and returns 0 to indicate success. If the new severity is out of range, it returns 1. 
If the incident is not found in the system, it returns -1.

This function removes a compliance incident from a management system by finding the index of the 
incident to be removed, shifting all incidents after the removed incident back by one index, 
and decrementing the number of incidents in the system. If the incident is not found, 
the function returns without removing anything.
